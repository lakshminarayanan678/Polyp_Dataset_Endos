### ðŸ“Š Datasets

This work aggregates publicly available colonoscopy datasets for polyp detection and classification.

### âœ… Benchmark Datasets

The following datasets were used as benchmarks for evaluation, as they are widely adopted in prior research:

CVC-ClinicDB

CVC-ColonDB

ETIS-LaribDB

### ðŸ“¦ Training Datasets

The remaining datasets were used to build a composite training set and for pretraining models, enabling both:

Intra-dataset testing â€“ training and evaluating on splits of the same dataset.

Inter-dataset testing â€“ training on one dataset and evaluating on unseen datasets to assess generalization.
