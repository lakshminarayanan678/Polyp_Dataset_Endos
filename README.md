### ðŸ“Š Datasets

This work aggregates publicly available colonoscopy datasets for polyp detection and classification.

### âœ… Benchmark Datasets

The following datasets were used as benchmarks for evaluation, as they are widely adopted in prior research:
- CVC-ClinicDB
- CVC-ColonDB 
- ETIS-LaribDB

### ðŸ“¦ Training Datasets

The remaining datasets were used to build a composite training set and for pretraining models, enabling both:
- Intra-dataset testing â€“ training and evaluating on splits of the same dataset.
- Inter-dataset testing â€“ training on one dataset and evaluating on unseen datasets to assess generalization.

# ðŸ“‚ Polyp Datasets  

This repository consolidates multiple gastrointestinal (GI) polyp datasets into a unified structure for both classification and segmentation tasks. All datasets have been standardized in terms of naming, format, and organization.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ DATA  
The `DATA/` folder contains the **collated master dataset**.  
- All images and annotations from different sources (Kvasir-SEG, CVC, PolypGen, LD-PolypVideo, Real-COLON, KUMC, etc.) are unified here.  
- Files are renamed with a dataset prefix (e.g., `Kvasir-SEG_xxx.jpg`, `realcolon_xxx.jpg`, `kumc_xxx.jpg`, `polypgen_xxx.jpg`) for traceability.  
- A `log.txt` file summarizes dataset integrity and statistics, including:  
  - Total number of images and annotations.  
  - Count of polyp vs. non-polyp images.  
  - Images with multiple polyps.  
  - Polyp count distribution (when available).  

---

### ðŸ”¹ SPLITDATA  
The `SPLITDATA/` folder contains the **train/validation/test splits** derived from the `DATA/` folder.  
- The entire collated dataset (`DATA/`) is split into train, val, and test sets.  
- These splits are **not per dataset** but rather across the full combined dataset.  
- A `log.txt` file here records split statistics (number of images, annotation matches, polyp vs. non-polyp counts, multiple polyps, etc.).  

---

### ðŸ”¹ SEGDATASETS  
The `SegDatasets/` folder contains datasets that include **segmentation masks**.  
- Each dataset with masks (e.g., **Kvasir-SEG, CVC-Clinic, CVC-Colon, ETIS-Larib**) has its own subfolder.  
- Each subfolder includes images, masks, and a `log.txt` file that reports dataset statistics (total images, multiple polyps, CSV with normalized paths, etc.).  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Logs & Integrity Checks  
- Every dataset folder (in `DATA/`, `SPLITDATA/`, and `SegDatasets/`) contains a `log.txt` file.  
- These logs ensure reproducibility by documenting:  
  - Dataset size and integrity (imageâ€“annotation matches).  
  - Polyp vs. non-polyp distribution.  
  - Multiple polyp breakdowns with file references.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Balancing Strategy  
Some datasets, particularly **Real-COLON**, originally contained significantly more non-polyp than polyp images. To address this imbalance:  
- The number of non-polyp images was reduced by half in each subset.  
- This adjustment ensures a more balanced ratio between polyp and non-polyp images for training.
